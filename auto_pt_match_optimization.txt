Automate point match optimization

1. Need to run over an ensemble of pair of tiles
2. Need to define the max breadth of options for parameters to test
3. Specify a criteria for the # of pt matches/ # of inliers, the time it takes to produce these 
4. Filter the parameter set and pick the best based on that set that satisfies (3)
